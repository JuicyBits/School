    - ~4 Use Case Diagrams

**CASE** - Computer Assisted Software Engineering  

**DFD Diagram** - Data Flow Diagram graphically rep. flow of Data w/in an Information System  
- Show all possible data flows within a System

**Context Diagram** - Defines boundary b/n System -- or Parts of the System -- and its environment / entities  
- A context diagram is a top level (also known as "Level 0") **DFD**

A **DFD Fragment** is one part of a DFD that will eventually be combined w/ other fragments to form the DFD  
- *i.e. DFD 0 Fragment*
- Make sure all info. given to a user are obtained from a **Data Store**
- Follow predefined **layouts** if they exist (if not, create)

**Common DFD Errors**  
***Should***
- Include data flow in one direction (no two-headed arrows **<--->**)
- Every set of DFDs must have one **Context Diagram**
- Process should have at least one output

**DFD** 0 has integer processes (not decimal)
